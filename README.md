## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Git (optional for version control)

### Steps

#### 1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dignified-living-care.git
cd dignified-living-care
```

#### 2. **Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. **Install the required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. **Create a .env file in the project root:**

```bash
touch .env
```

#### 5. **Add the following environment variables to the .env file:**

```env
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

An app password is a long, randomly generated password that you provide only once instead of your regular password when signing in to an app or device that doesn't support two-step verification.

### Usage

**Running the Application Locally:**

#### 1. **Start the Flask development server:**

```bash
python app.py
```

or with gunicorn

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:app
```

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `gunicorn`: The Gunicorn server.
- `-w 4`: This flag specifies the number of worker processes. Adjust this number based on your appâ€™s requirements and server resources.
- `-b 0.0.0.0:8000`: This flag binds the server to all IP addresses on port 8000. Adjust the port if necessary.
- `wsgi:app`: This specifies the module and application. wsgi is the module name (i.e., wsgi.py without the .py extension), and app is the Flask application instance.

#### 2. **Open your web browser and go to:**

```arduino
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Testing the Contact Form:**

Fill out the contact form on the webpage and submit it. If everything is set up correctly, you should receive an email with the form submission details.
